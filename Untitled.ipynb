    "Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. It disrupts the normal flow of the program and can be handled using try-except blocks. Exceptions can arise due to various reasons, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **File not found:** When trying to open a file that doesn't exist.\n",
    "* **Division by zero:** Attempting to divide a number by zero.\n",
    "* **IndexError:** Accessing an index out of range in a list or tuple.\n",
    "* **TypeError:** Using an incorrect data type in an operation.\n",
    "* **ValueError:** Passing an invalid argument to a function.\n",
    "* **KeyError:** Trying to access a key that doesn't exist in a dictionary.\n",
    "* **ImportError:** Failing to import a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax Errors vs. Exceptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Syntax Errors | Exceptions |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| Occurrence | Detected by the Python interpreter before the program runs. | Occur during the execution of the program. |\n",
    "| Cause | Incorrect syntax or grammar in the code. | Runtime errors due to invalid operations or conditions. |\n",
    "| Handling | Cannot be handled with try-except blocks. The program terminates. | Can be handled using try-except blocks to prevent program crashes. |\n",
    "| Examples | Missing parentheses, incorrect indentation, misspelled keywords. | Division by zero, file not found, index out of range. |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    result = 10 / num\n",
    "    print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, if the user enters 0, a `ZeroDivisionError` exception occurs. The `try-except` block catches this exception and prints an error message instead of causing the program to crash.\n"

    "**Q2. What happens when an exception is not handled? Explain with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is not handled in Python, the program terminates abruptly with an error message. This message typically includes the type of exception, a traceback showing the line where the exception occurred, and a brief description of the error. This behavior can disrupt the normal flow of the program and make it difficult to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "result = 10 / num\n",
    "print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user enters 0, a `ZeroDivisionError` exception will occur. Since there's no `try-except` block to handle it, the program will terminate with an error message like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"your_file.py\", line 3, in <module>\n",
    "    result = 10 / num\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This error message provides information about the exception, the line where it occurred, and the reason for the error. However, it doesn't allow the program to continue execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Therefore, it's crucial to handle exceptions using `try-except` blocks to prevent unexpected program termination and provide more robust error handling.**\n"

    "**Q3. Which Python statements are used to catch and handle exceptions? Explain with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` statements are used to catch and handle exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`try`:** This block contains the code that might raise an exception.\n",
    "* **`except`:** This block is executed if an exception occurs within the `try` block. You can specify the type of exception you want to catch.\n",
    "* **`else`:** This block is executed if no exception occurs within the `try` block.\n",
    "* **`finally`:** This block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurs. It's often used for cleanup tasks like closing files or database connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",

    "Q4. Explain with an example:#\n",
    " try and else#\n",

    "+ raise\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:   In Python, `try`, `else`, `finally`, and `raise` are used for handling exceptions and managing control flow in the presence of errors. Here's an overview of each, along with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `try` and `else`\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `try` block lets you test a block of code for errors.\n",
    "- The `else` block runs if the `try` block does not raise an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `finally`\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `finally` block will execute regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It's typically used for cleanup actions (like closing files).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `raise`\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `raise` statement is used to trigger an exception manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's put this all together in an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide_numbers(num1, num2):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        result = num1 / num2  # Attempt to divide\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError:  # Handle division by zero\n",
    "        print(\"Error: Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "        raise  # Re-raise the exception\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Division successful. The result is:\", result)\n",
    "    finally:\n",
    "        print(\"Execution of divide_numbers is complete.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage example:\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    divide_numbers(10, 0)  # This will cause an error\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Caught an exception in the outer block.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`try` Block**: We attempt to divide `num1` by `num2`.\n",
    "2. **`except` Block**: If `num2` is zero, a `ZeroDivisionError` is caught, a message is printed, and we re-raise the exception.\n",
    "3. **`else` Block**: If the division is successful (i.e., no exceptions), it prints the result.\n",
    "4. **`finally` Block**: This block executes after the `try` and `except`, whether or not an exception occurred. Itâ€™s used here to indicate that the function's execution is complete.\n",
    "5. **Outer `try` Block**: This catches the re-raised `ZeroDivisionError`, allowing for additional handling or logging outside of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run `divide_numbers(10, 0)`, you'll see:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Error: Cannot divide by zero.\n",
    "Execution of divide_numbers is complete.\n",
    "Caught an exception in the outer block.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This illustrates how `try`, `except`, `else`, `finally`, and `raise` work together to manage errors gracefully in Python."

    "Q6. Create a custom exception class. Use this class to handle an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  Creating a custom exception class in Python allows you to define specific error types that can provide more context about the error condition. Here's how to create a custom exception and use it to handle an exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom Exception Class\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class NegativeValueError(Exception):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Custom exception to indicate that a negative value is not allowed.\"\"\"\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "        self.value = value\n",
    "        super().__init__(f\"NegativeValueError: {value} is not allowed. Please provide a positive value.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def process_value(value):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Process the value and raise a custom exception if the value is negative.\"\"\"\n",
    "    if value < 0:\n",
    "        raise NegativeValueError(value)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(f\"Processing value: {value}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    process_value(-10)  # This will trigger the custom exception\n",
    "except NegativeValueError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)  # Output the custom error message\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Custom Exception Class**:\n",
    "   - `NegativeValueError` is a subclass of `Exception`.\n",
    "   - The `__init__` method takes a `value` parameter and initializes the base class with a custom error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function with Exception Handling**:\n",
    "   - `process_value` checks if the provided `value` is negative.\n",
    "   - If it is, the function raises the custom `NegativeValueError`.\n",
    "   - If the value is valid (non-negative), it prints the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example Usage**:\n",
    "   - A `try` block attempts to call `process_value` with a negative number.\n",
    "   - The `except` block catches the `NegativeValueError` and prints the custom error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the above code with `process_value(-10)`, the output will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "NegativeValueError: -10 is not allowed. Please provide a positive value.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates how to create and handle a custom exception in Python, providing clearer error handling in your applications."
